Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the skills lerned to collect and clean a data set. 
This project beging with obtaing data of a webside and transform create a tidy data for an analyze. 

The project contain:
CodeBook.md = describes variables, data transformation and how clean the datas
README.md = breafly explanation of project
run_analysis.R = contain script file with R code

The R code following the next directions

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
